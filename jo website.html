    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>I work part-time at <strong>Survive-All</strong>, my father’s company focused on outdoor and survival programs. This experience inspired my dream: to start my own company offering extreme, unforgettable team-building adventures. I also run a boat rental company owned by my family, where I’m responsible for operations and customer experiences.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work in the Netherlands at <strong>MSR Cheesy</strong>, gaining valuable hospitality industry experience while continuing my academic journey.</p>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Ivan Kun, a 20-year-old student at NHL Stenden University. I come from Budapest, Hungary, where I grew up in a well-situated family. Since childhood, I’ve been dedicated to sports and discipline—I trained a lot and played water polo for 13 years, which taught me teamwork, endurance, and resilience.</p>
    <p>I consider myself a strong and adventurous person who loves exploring new places and pushing limits. My hobbies include drumming, cycling, boxing, and working out. I also enjoy driving aimlessly just for the love of the road. One of my passions is my car—I take care of it like a true friend.</p>

  <section id="future">
    <h2>Future Vision</h2>
    <p>After finishing my studies at NHL Stenden, I plan to start my own extreme team-building company within the next 3 years. My values, such as adventure, discipline, creativity, and authenticity, will be the foundation of my business. My past and present shape my future. My father's company taught me the ropes, and now I’m ready to build something of my own.</p>
    <p>But I don’t just dream of career success. I want to build a life that includes family too. One of my biggest dreams is to become a father. I love kids and can’t wait to have a family of my own one day. Another dream of mine is to live in the United States. The energy, opportunities, and space for adventure in America inspire me, and I want to build my future there.</p>

    <h2>Leadership Reflection - MapsTell</h2>
    <p>Based on MapsTell, I discovered I’m naturally active and action-oriented. I want to further develop my ability to listen and reflect more before acting. In the future, I want to be a leader who motivates others not by control, but by example, creativity, and authenticity. This fits perfectly with my goals of building a bold, people-centered team-building company.</p>
